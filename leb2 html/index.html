        <h2>Why I Admire Them</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam  was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.</li>
          <li>A reason you might like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is because he was a symbol of humility, intelligence, and dedication. Despite coming from a modest background, he rose to become one of India’s most respected scientists and later the President of India—all while staying grounded and inspiring millions with his vision for a better future.</li>
          <li>Kalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the "People's President". He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</li>
